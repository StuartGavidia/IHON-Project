        <p>The Lives of the 12 Caesars showcased events that supported and ultimately led to the rule of Augustus.
        <br> The author of The Lives of the 12 Caesars, Suetonius, focused on explaining why Augustus was set to be ruler of 
        Rome because of Prophecy, by referencing numerous Roman figures like Quintus Catulus and Marcus Cicero. 
        <br> Along with those sources, it is also important to keep in mind that the Romans, as described by Suetonius,
        are a society that truly believes in prophecy. Omens are what eventually convinced Julius Caesar to choose Augustus as 
        his successor. 
        <br>Prophecy for a future ruler plays a big role in Roman culture, especially as Rome faced political problems.
        Like the conspiracy of Catiline mentioned by Suetonius, and soon after, the assasination if Julius Caesar.</p>

        <p>The Life of Muhammad went over the youth of the Prophet Muhhamad.
        <br> The Life of Muhhamad was an interesting piece of work. You have God directly choosing Muhammad as the Prophet. 
        Ibn Ishaq makes it clear that the prophet was an important man. 
        <br> There is a contrast between the two texts, because Muhammad grows up in Mecca where numerous groups
        are following polythesitic practices. Not surprising because Mecca was a trading center connecting numerous groups.
