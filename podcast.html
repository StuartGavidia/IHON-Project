          Stuart: “What is good everyone” <br>
	        Lilyan: “Hello!” <br>
	        Stuart: “I’m Stuart” <br>
          Lilyan: “I’m Lilyan, and welcome to our IHON final project: All Things Reconsidered”<br>
	        Stuart: “We read a wide variety of texts in this class from many eras and topics, which made it hard to stick with just two.”<br>
	        Lilyan: “Right, and there were a lot of interesting themes too; I remember scrolling through our schedule and not being sure where to start. But there were a few times when we were reading texts and I had a ‘A-ha! This is connected!’ moment, so we went for one of those.<br>
	        Stuart: During our readings in class and in our review, we both noticed a common theme in ‘The Life of Muhammad’ and ‘The Lives of the 12 Caesars’” *Wait 0.6 seconds* “Prophecy!”<br>
          Lilyan: “In particular, after reading these texts, we wanted to discuss how the theme of Prophecy would play into the lives of Muhammad and Augustus Caesar.”<br>

          12 Caesars Introduction:<br>

          Stuart: “The Lives of the 12 Caesars showcased events that supported and ultimately led to the rule of Augustus while The Life of Muhammad covered the youth of the prophet.<br>
          Lilyan: “Yeah, the author of The 12 Caesars, Suetonius, focused on explaining why Augustus was set to be ruler of Rome because of Prophecy while referencing numerous Roman figures like Quintus Catulus and Marcus Cicero. In his depiction, both figures have prophetic dreams about a boy being favored by Jupiter, and then encounter Augustus, saying ‘ he was the very one whose form had appeared to him in his dream.’”<br>
          Stuart: “Why would Suetionius do that? Since it was written after Augustus’s death, why would it matter?”<br>
          Lilyan: “Well, it is important to keep in mind that the Romans were a society that truly believed in prophecy. According to the text, omens were what eventually convinced Julius Caesar to choose Augustus as his successor. Though Suetonius’ word alone can’t prove Caesar’s reasoning, it does show that prophecy was important to society at large.”<br>
          Stuart: “Why were omens so key? Couldn’t Julius Caesar have just selected a successor?”<br>
          Lilyan: “Well, he could have, but it wouldn’t have worked out, because then he wouldn’t have had legitimacy.”<br>
          Stuart: “Legitimacy?” <br>
          Lilyan: “Yeah! Just like how in the United States our leader is selected with elections, which makes the leadership valid, ancient Rome selected their rulers based on social status and omens, which also made people view leadership as valid.”<br>
          Stuart: “So, it’s what convinces people to believe a ruler has the right to rule?”<br>
          Lilyan: “Yep! Without it, there’s a lot of confusion and turmoil, which would be disastrous for any place, let alone one as big as the Roman empire.”<br>
          Stuart: “Augustus was Julius Caesar's successor, right?”<br>
          Lilyan: “Yep, Suetonius himself says so.” <br>
          Stuart: “And I think everyone knows Julius was assassinated.”<br>
          Lilyan: *laugh* “Yeah.”<br>
          Stuart: “Then, legitimacy would be more important, right? Cause it would be hard to have someone replace an assassinated guy..”<br>
          Lilyan: “Yeah, that’s exactly right. Prophecy was important to the Romans in many ways, but it was especially important here because of the circumstances of Augustus’ ascension to power. Any kind of political controversy makes transfer of power more difficult, as we well know, and Julius Caesar’s death was certainly controversial.”<br>
          Stuart: I remember that Augustus’ rise to power was when Rome was in a political crisis, and it is important to understand that politics and religion are closely connected to one another in Rome.  Another attempt at legitimizing the prophecy of Augustus was through an epic poem, The Aeneid. The Aeneid was written around the time Augustus became ruler of Rome. In the poem, there are comparisons between Augustus and the character Aeneas. The author Virgil links these two men, and supports Augustus as a rightful ruler. Stating that they both “brought back stability and security after a period of war and destruction.”(Sabine, 1959) This legitimizes their positions in an epic manner, and certainly after the assasination of Julius Caesar that was important.”<br>
          Lilyan: “The Romans were afraid of a tyrant, which is why they assassinated Caesar. How would they legitimize Augustus as a sole ruler through this text?”<br>
          Lilyan: Oh yeah, and The Aeneid(eye-uh-neyed) also linked Augustus to several mythic kings. To show that the rule of Augustus is grounded in the divine and the mythical origins of Rome, on which Virgil writes, that he “traces Augustus’ political position not merely to Romulus, the mythic founder of Rome, but even further back in Roman History to Aeneas(ah-eh-nay-us), the founder of the Roman People”(Sabine, 1959).<br>
          Stuart: “Back to The Lives of the 12 Caesars text, if Suetonius was a historian, why was he trying to emphasize the legitimacy of previous rulers? Wouldn’t he have wanted to just account how the 12 Caesars came to be rulers?”<br>
          Lilyan: “It would be easy to think that, but Roman historians are a little different from modern ones. Suetonius himself worked with the Roman government, even so far as to become Emperor Hadrian’s secretary(T. Editors of Encyclopaedia, 2021) Roman historians were generally employed by the rulers in order to bolster their own reputation, instead of their modern counterparts, many of which work on accounts of history separately.”<br>
          Stuart: “Ohh, I see, it was his goal to maintain legitimacy, and he was helping the current ruler by ensuring that the past ones were viewed as rightful rulers as well.”<br>
          Lilyan: “Right! Exactly.”<br>
          Stuart: “So, that’s how prophecy plays into our first text. Should we discuss the second one?”<br>
          Lilyan: “Sure! The Life of Muhhamad, a sira– meaning a prophetic biography– was an interesting piece of work. You have God directly choosing Muhammad as the Prophet. Ibn Ishaq makes it clear in the Sira that the prophet was an important man. What’s the significance of that?”<br>
          Stuart: “Well, Muhammad grew up in Mecca, where numerous groups followed polythesitic practices, which is unsurprising because Mecca was a trading hub. Muhammad, on the other hand, was adovcating for a monotheistic religion, which was highly controversial and not well recieved among locals, at least initially.”<br>
          Lilyan: Right! I remember that being described by Ibn Ishaq.  For some context, the elite of the town in Mecca, the Quraysh, did not like Muhammad and attempted to negotiate with him through ransom or threats.  Initially, they believed Muhammad would disrupt the ‘social and commercial equilibrium of Mecca’(Peters, 2010). It wasn’t until later that they would change their mind.<br>
          Stuart: Yeah, and even centuries later, Thomas Acquinas, a Catholic priest, did not believe that Muhammad was a legitimate prophet. He believed that along with predicting future events, a prophet must receive knowledge through divine means and share it with others. Prophecy is "a kind of knowledge impressed under the form of teaching on the prophet's intellect by Divine revelation"(Moreland, 2013). Acquinas simply did not believe that Muhammad fell in that category.<br>
          Lilyan: It is interesting to note that even today, there are scholars who believe that the Quran should be accepted by Christians so that Islam and Christianity could better understand each other. And Muhammad is still a controversial figure!”<br>
          Stuart: “Exactly right. People with beliefs that contradict those of Islam tend to disregard Muhammad as an important historical figure, and/or Islam as a whole. There is even controversy among Muslims, as they split into factions after Muhammad’s death, permanently dividing the religion. In fact, “The Sira was later edited by Ibn Hisham (d. 833), who removed material he believed to be objectionable to the emerging Sunni consensus”(Campo, 2016).<br>
          Lilyan: “Then, legitimacy would also be important, right?”<br>
          Stuart: “Absolutely, but not exactly in the same way. We can go into comparisons later, though. However, the base concept is the same; Muhammad is notably portrayed to be chosen by God.”<br>
          Lilyan: “How does Ishaq’s work show that?”<br>
          Stuart: “Well, similarly to Augustus, Muhammad’s birth and adoption are told accompanied by prophetic dreams and good fortune. Ishaq records “Amina d. Wahb, the mother of God's apostle, used to say when she was pregnant with God's apostle that a voice said to her, "You are pregnant with the lord of this people and when he is born say, 'I put him in the care of the One from the evil of every envier; then call him Muhammad.'"”<br>
          Lilyan: “Do you think that really happened?”<br>
          Stuart: “Does it matter? Ishaq’s goal here is to emphasize Muhammad’s importance as a divine figure to the audience, not to record complete historical facts, so he accomplishes this goal through anecdotes regardless of how much truth they hold. Ibn Ishaq even writes in the Sira, which is believed to be Muhammad’s own account, Ishaq describes the encounter that Muhammad had with the angel Gabriel. Where Gabriel tells Muhammad that he is the ‘Apostle of God’(Peters, 2010). There are only a few verses that describe Muhammad’s experience with the supernatural. And in the Quran there is a similar story, and it seems to be God, since Muhammad is called ‘his servant’.”<br>
          Lilyan: “Right, that makes sense. Then, what’s the significance of emphasizing his birth? It’s not like he was meant to be an heir to power like Augustus.”<br>
          Stuart: “Well, that is true, but if you remember, Muhammad was both an orphan and lacked the ability to read. Although some Muslim scholars, including Tariq Ramadana, say that “being both an orphan and poor was actually an initiatory state for the future Messenger of God,”(Ramadan, 2007) these factors still both made it important to emphasize Muhammad’s credibility to outsiders.”<br>
          Lilyan: “Why was that an ‘initiatory state’?”<br>
          Stuart: “Well, in Mecca where Muhammad lived, it was not uncommon to be poor and uneducated. The fact that Muhammad was such would have caused him to be more relatable and connected to his community, as opposed to being a well educated and rich scholar.”<br>
          Lilyan: “Makes sense, people within your social class are easier to connect with.”<br>
          Stuart: “Right! It’s like a balance between having divine recognition in order to be someone important, but not losing his roots in order to connect with the people around him.”<br>
          Lilyan: Even so, there are still groups of people that do not see Muhammad as legitimate. The Quran would talk about the miracles that prophets like Jesus and Moses performed. And Muhammad refused to perform any miracles, saying that the Quran is the miracle proving that he was the ‘envoy of God’(Peters, 2010). This alone would make it difficult for Muhammad to establish his legitmacy through a divine connection. Also, he is prophesied as the final messenger, which goes against what Christians believe.<br>
          Stuart: Exactly and Muhammad would even die of natural causes(Peters, 2010), unlike Jesus who died during the crucifixion and was resurrected through divine means.<br>

          Comparison/Deeper Analysis:<br>

          Lilyan: “How does this compare and contrast with Suetonius’s work?”<br>
          Stuart: “Well, Augustus was portrayed to be blessed by the gods similarly to Muhammad, right?”<br>
          Lilyan: “That’s right! He’s depicted in several dream accounts as being given a position of power by Jupiter himself.”<br>
          Stuart: “That’s really similar to Muhammad, then. They’re both represented through ‘prophecy’ as being chosen by the divine and therefore worthy of their positions.”<br>
          Lilyan: “Hm, they are similar, but there’s a lot of differences, too, even if the underlying idea is the same. Because there are such fundamental differences in their lives, it makes sense.”<br>
          Stuart: “Augustus is the ruler of Rome, and Suetonius is trying to defend his validity as such, because he is working for the current government and wishes to uphold the legitimacy of the current one, yeah?”<br>
          Lilyan: “Yeah, that’s right. And Ishaq is recording the stories told about the birth of Muhammad, who was and still is a controversial figure, so the stories compiled by Ishaq attempt to balance credibility with connection.”<br>
          Stuart: “ After we read the Life of Muhammad and the texts had so much similarity, I could see that instead of Augustus being prophesied to be ruler, the prophecy was instead written to back up the selection.”<br>
          Lilyan: “Yeah! That makes sense. It’s interesting to note that both of these texts were first written or recorded after the deaths of their subjects. That doesn’t really make much sense to me- why would you need to prove the legitimacy of someone that’s already dead?”<br>
          Stuart: “Well, it’s like you said before; the history of Augustus was written by a historian working for the Empire, and it would make sense that in order to convince people that the current Emperor was legitimately selected, then the previous ones would have to be as well.”<br>
          Lilyan: “Oh, I see! It all has to do with the author’s purpose!”<br>
          Stuart: “Right, exactly.”<br>
          Lilyan: “Then, Ishaq’s purpose in recording the stories of Muhammad right after his death would play into it as well. After all, Islamic people split into factions over the controversy of Muhammad’s successor, so uplifting him as a way to unite Muslims and increase their credibility to outsiders also makes sense. However, seeing that Muhammad is represented with his low social status vs how Augustus is described with a higher one, the differences in what is valued in their respective societies is clear in the output.”<br>
          Stuart: “So in the end, it seems the 12 Caesars and the Life of Muhammad have a lot of similarities but for slightly different purposes. However, both are able to demonstrate a lot about the importance of prophecy to society and the ways it is used to bolster legitimacy.”<br>

          Ending Wrap Up: What changed in our perspective of The Lives of the 12 Caesars change after reading The Life of Muhammad? Fully flush out and reiterate our thesis.<br>

          Stuart: “In the Life of Muhhamad, I took note of how everywhere Muhammad would go as a child, God would support him such as providing Muhammad and his caregivers with an abundance of milk. Muhamad was portrayed as predestined to become a prophet. In the same manner, after Augustus was proclaimed to be ruler by the omens, it’s as if everyone around him did the best they could to make him a ruler. After seeing the similarities of both, I could recognize the ways in which prophecy was used as a tool to bolster both of their respective legitimacies.”<br>
          Lilyan: “While I read The Lives of the 12 Caesars, I can see how aspects of the life of Augustus like being the son of a senator, spending time with Julius Caesar, and getting an education, would allow him to rise as a leader of Rome as opposed to Muhhamad being born into a poor socioeconomic class. It gets me thinking about the differences in portraying a legitimate message between The Lives of the 12 Caesars and The Life of Muhhamad. While Muhhammad being poor would appeal to more people in Mecca, more epic stories were the focus to appeal to people in Rome.”<br>
          Stuart: “Prophecy plays a key role in both of these figure’s lives by upholding their legitimacy and maintaining their credibility. These texts have a lot more in common than we initially thought, but also some key differences, and exploring the two is very interesting.”<br>
          Lilyan “Yeah! Well that concludes our podcast! Hope you thought about something new, and thank you all for tuning in. Goodbye!”<br>
          Stuart: “Bye!”<br>
